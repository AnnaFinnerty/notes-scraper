# notes-scraper

The Mac Notes App is great, but doesn't offer great options for exporting your notes. 

The script contained in notes-scraper.js runs in Mac Script Editor and lets you batch export notes as HTML documents or plain text.

Note: Content in the Notes App is HTML by default, and exporting as HTML is usually cleaner.

## installation instructions

1) Used CMD + spacebar to search for and open Script Editor

2) Open a new blank script 

3) Copy/paste the contents of notes-scraper.js into the blank script, give it any name you'd like, and save. 

4) Click the run button at the top of the script. 

5) Select 'Run Script' (not the default, 'Run Application') and follow the prompts.
